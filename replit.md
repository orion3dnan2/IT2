# IT Asset Management System

## Overview

This is a bilingual (English/Arabic) IT Asset Management web application built with Python Flask. The system helps IT departments track and manage hardware assets including computers, monitors, printers, scanners, and network devices. It provides features for inventory management, asset assignment to employees, maintenance tracking, and reporting with a modern, responsive interface supporting both light and dark modes.

**Status**: Fully functional MVP with all core features implemented and tested.

## User Preferences

- Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language
- Language support: Bilingual (Arabic/English)
- UI Design: Modern, clean, responsive with royal blue, silver gray, and emerald green color palette
- Dark mode: Fully supported with localStorage persistence

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture

**Framework**: Flask with Blueprint-based modular architecture
- Blueprints organize features into separate modules: `auth`, `dashboard`, `assets`, `employees`, `maintenance`, and `main`
- Each blueprint handles its own routing and business logic independently

**ORM & Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL
- Database connection uses psycopg2-binary driver
- SQLAlchemy handles all database operations with model-based queries
- Flask-Migrate available for database schema migrations
- Configuration uses DATABASE_URL environment variable from Replit

**Authentication & Authorization**: Flask-Login
- Role-based access control with three levels: `admin`, `staff`, and `viewer`
- Password hashing using Werkzeug security utilities
- Session-based authentication with configurable session secrets
- Permission checking implemented through `User.has_permission()` method

**Internationalization**: Flask-Babel
- Supports English and Arabic with automatic RTL/LTR layout switching
- Translation directories managed through Babel configuration at `app/translations`
- Language selection stored in session and can be changed dynamically
- Locale detection from session or browser preferences

### Frontend Architecture

**UI Framework**: TailwindCSS (CDN-based for development)
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Dark mode support with localStorage persistence
- Custom color palette: royal blue (#1e3a8a), silver gray (#64748b), and emerald green (#10b981)
- Conditional RTL/LTR styling based on selected language

**Typography**:
- Arabic: Cairo font from Google Fonts
- English: Inter font from Google Fonts

**Icons**: Font Awesome 6.4.0 for consistent iconography

**JavaScript**: Vanilla JavaScript for:
- Dark mode toggle functionality
- Mobile sidebar menu toggle
- Client-side interactivity

**Templates**: Jinja2 templating with inheritance
- Base layout (`base/layout.html`) provides core HTML structure with language detection
- Dashboard layout (`base/dashboard_layout.html`) adds sidebar navigation
- Feature-specific templates extend dashboard layout

### Data Model

**Core Entities**:
- **User**: Authentication and authorization with roles (admin/staff/viewer)
- **Asset**: IT hardware with type, status, warranty tracking, and assignment
- **Employee**: Staff members who can be assigned assets
- **Department**: Organizational units for both employees and assets
- **Maintenance**: Service records linked to assets with bilingual descriptions
- **AssetHistory**: Audit trail for asset changes

**Relationships**:
- Assets can be assigned to employees and departments (many-to-one)
- Assets have multiple maintenance records and history entries (one-to-many with cascade delete)
- Employees belong to departments and can have multiple assigned assets
- Maintenance records link to assets and track who created them
- Asset history tracks all changes with user attribution

**Key Features**:
- Bilingual field support (name_en/name_ar, description_en/description_ar)
- Automatic timestamp tracking (created_at, updated_at)
- Soft delete support through is_active flags
- Warranty expiration tracking with computed property

## Default Login Credentials

The system comes pre-configured with three user accounts for testing different access levels:

- **Admin**: Username: `admin`, Password: `admin123` (Full access to all features)
- **Staff**: Username: `staff`, Password: `staff123` (Can view and edit, cannot delete)
- **Viewer**: Username: `viewer`, Password: `viewer123` (View-only access)

## Sample Data

The database is seeded with:
- 5 Departments (IT, Finance, HR, Marketing, Operations)
- 5 Employees across different departments
- 10 Assets (computers, monitors, printers, scanners, network devices)
- Realistic warranty dates and assignments

## Running the Application

The application is configured to run automatically via the Server workflow:
- Command: `python run.py`
- Port: 5000
- URL: Accessible via Replit webview

To reset the database:
```bash
python seed_data.py
```
