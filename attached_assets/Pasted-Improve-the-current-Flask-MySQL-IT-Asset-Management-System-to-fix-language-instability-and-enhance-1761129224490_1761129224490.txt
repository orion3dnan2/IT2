Improve the current Flask + MySQL IT Asset Management System to fix language instability and enhance the overall responsive design.

🎯 Goal:
Ensure that when the user switches to Arabic, the entire web app (layout, navbar, sidebar, dashboard, charts, and tables) fully switches to RTL direction and Arabic interface — and when switched to English, everything reverts cleanly to LTR. The language should persist across all pages.

🧩 Technical Tasks:

1. **Language Direction (RTL/LTR):**
   - Automatically apply `<html dir="rtl" lang="ar">` when Arabic is active, and `<html dir="ltr" lang="en">` when English is active.
   - Use Flask-Babel for language management.
   - Store selected language in `session['lang']` and reload page after switching.
   - Add a route `/lang/<lang_code>` to change language (ar/en).

2. **Separate Stylesheets:**
   - Add two CSS files:
     - `style_rtl.css` → for Arabic layout (right alignment, Cairo or Tajawal font)
     - `style_ltr.css` → for English layout (left alignment, Inter or Roboto font)
   - Load dynamically based on the selected language.

3. **Navbar Language Switcher:**
   - Keep the Arabic/EN toggle at the top-right corner.
   - Make it reload the app with correct direction and texts.

4. **Dashboard Layout:**
   - All text, icons, and cards align correctly according to language direction.
   - RTL version should display Arabic labels properly:
     - “نظام الأصول”, “الأصول حسب النوع”, “عدد الإدارات”, “الأجهزة قيد الإصلاح” etc.
   - Use consistent spacing and padding in RTL mode.

5. **Responsive UI Enhancements:**
   - Use TailwindCSS or Bootstrap 5 responsive grid.
   - Sidebar collapses automatically on mobile.
   - Cards and charts adapt to mobile width.
   - Font size and icon spacing optimized for smaller devices.

6. **Persistence:**
   - Save selected language in session or user profile.
   - Ensure switching language updates all UI texts and layout immediately.

7. **Testing:**
   - Test Arabic mode (RTL) on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
   - Ensure charts, cards, and tables display correctly with Arabic numerals and labels.

- Modern flat color palette (Royal Blue, Emerald Green, Orange, White)
- Smooth transition animation between languages
- Consistent rounded cards with shadows
- Font: “Cairo” (Arabic), “Inter” (English)

✅ **Expected Result:**
A fully bilingual (Arabic-English) Flask web app with stable language switching, correct RTL/LTR rendering, consistent dashboard layout, and a fully responsive interface across all screens and devices.
